These files can be found in the `migrations` folder, once you have created a migration of course. **Note **These files can be edited as well . If you somehow make a mistake in a future migration, you can roll back a migration by simply using a previous migration\n",

    "For example:\n",
    "    Say I have two migrations (0001-initial.py and 0002-update.py) and I realized that I added a field inside a model that I didn't want. I can roll back to the first migration by giving the `migrate` keyword the name of the previous migration (0001-initial.py in this case). This revert the database back to it's previous state and you can add/remove to it as necessary. "
