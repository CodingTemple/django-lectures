This method of hiding input fields is something known as honeypot. Basically, a bot will always fill out every field it avaialble, while a human user will only fill out what can be seen. Therefore, what you want to check for is if the hidden field has any input, if it does you may want to stop the submitting of the form and/or keep a log of how many times this happens.**"
